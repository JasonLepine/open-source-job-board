{"name":"Open Source Job Board","tagline":"An Open Source Job Board built with Ruby on Rails","body":"# Open Source Job Board\r\n\r\n**[DEMO](https://reactnativejobs.herokuapp.com/)**\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://cdn.rawgit.com/blairanderson/open-source-job-board/master/public/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nThis is the `readme.md` for a Ruby on Rails application that allows users to create accounts and post job listings.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nBecause when i was learning to program, I wanted to play with code that had a familiar model and get some instant gratification.\r\n\r\nThe problem with learning to code is the learning-curve. Shit is real and painful and i found that the best cure for the pain was cloning an app with features and tweaking until it broke and learning along the way.\r\n\r\nI think this is why wordpress is SO popular. Its stupid-easy to fire-up, and changes come with one-click package installs and tiny code changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n- A visitor can view the list of job posts\r\n- A visitor can view the job form, but is forced to signup before filling it out.\r\n- A visitor can register for an account\r\n- A user can login and logout\r\n- A user can submit a new job post\r\n- Admin dashboard at `/admin`, config in `rails_admin.rb` - admin is `user.id==1`\r\n- Posts can be `draft, published, archived`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Deploy?\r\n\r\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)\r\n\r\n*[learn more about](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/app-json-schema)*\r\n\r\n### Change the Code!!!\r\n\r\nMy main goal for this is to give new programmers some code to look at and talk about. Anytime i [get questions](https://github.com/blairanderson/open-source-job-board/issues), I plan to add them here...\r\n\r\nIf you're new to rails, follow this and come back http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/\r\n\r\n*Open your terminal*\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:blairanderson/open-source-job-board.git jobbr\r\n$ cd jobbr\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Lets look at some code*\r\n\r\nWhen someone visits your website, they're literally just *request*ing some HTML, CSS, and Javascript! *requests* come to your application through the ROUTER.\r\n\r\nSO you type something into google and hit enter, then click to the first result....\r\n\r\nyour web browser visits a website and the website starts to send HTML and CSS and Javascript.\r\n\r\n### [Checkout the Routes File](https://github.com/blairanderson/open-source-job-board/blob/master/config/routes.rb)\r\n","google":"UA-61052500-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
